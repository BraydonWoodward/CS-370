# CS-370
This repository is for my Computer Science Journal, Class CS370: Current/Emerging Trends (AI)

In this project, I implemented an intelligent agent capable of navigating a maze using deep Q-learning. I was provided with starter code that included the basic environment setup and experience replay functionality. Specifically, the TreasureMaze.py file handled the maze logic, and the GameExperience.py file managed the experience replay for training. My main contributions involved creating the deep Q-learning model, implementing the Q-training algorithm, and adding the dynamic epsilon decay mechanism to improve the agent's efficiency over time.

Throughout this course, I learned how reinforcement learning and artificial intelligence can address complex challenges. Computer scientists solve problems by breaking them into manageable parts, using algorithms, data structures, and systematic problem-solving techniques. This project gave me hands-on experience in algorithm design, model implementation, and iterative improvementâ€”all of which are core skills for a computer scientist.

Computer scientists build solutions that impact every aspect of our lives. Their work matters because it provides tools that enhance human capabilities, optimize processes, and solve problems at a scale that would be impossible for individuals alone. When tackling a problem, it is important to analyze requirements, design a suitable solution, and iterate while learning from feedback. In this project, our intelligent agent continuously improved by learning from its experiences, reflecting this iterative approach.

Ethically, I must ensure that the technologies I develop are safe, fair, and transparent. For the end user, this means the intelligent agent should behave predictably and without bias, while ensuring that its decision-making is understandable. For the organization, my responsibility is to ensure that the implementation is efficient, maintainable, and adheres to good software practices, reducing risks and maximizing benefits.
